/* TODO:
 * 
 * Paypal support.  Not sure how to implement this on the site itself as far as transfer of property goes.  Ideas on the board:
 * 1. Some sort of Escrow.  User purchases credit on the site and funds are only released to the seller when they are both happy i.e. leave good feedback
 * 2. Let the buyer and seller work it out themselves.  Easier for us here, but bad if a sale goes wrong.
 *    This is designed to be used for local sites where mail is not involved.  Users physically meet to exchange items / cash.
