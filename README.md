phpswapmeet
===========

A php framework for building online garage sale / swap meet style sites.  Can also be used / extended to do other things such as housing sites.

I started knocking this idea around in mid 2008 and worked on it in my spare time until 2009.

I thought I had lost the source to this but found it on an old backup buried in my attic.  Figured it was time to dust it off and start working on it again.

You will find some things are complete, some things are left undone, and some things just don't belong.  I was a young coder and made mistakes.  If you would like to help fix them, please issue bug reports or offer up a patch.

Releasing this under GPLv2 for everyone!

Enjoy
