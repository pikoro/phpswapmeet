<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>What is <?= $config[site][short_name] ?>?</h2>
<h3><?= $config[site][short_name] ?> is an Item Swapping website for people who live in Japan, but specifically on Okinawa.

<p>It is a place where people can get together to swap their unwanted items for things that they want.</p>

<p>We all know what its like to have stuff laying around that we want to get rid of, but wouldn't it be nice to be able to change your unwanted items for things that you really do want?</p>

<p>For example, say you have a video game that you have already played through, or you bought it and turns out it's not something you want to play.  Instead of selling it at a loss (nobody pays full price for anything used) why not trade it with someone else who has a game that you DO want to play.  They get a new game to try out, and you get to turn your unwanted game into something that you do want to play.</p>

<p>This same theory works for anything that you have.  That old TV sitting in your living room taking up too much space, but you really don't feel like trying to sell it since you'll lose money on it?  Why not post the item as available and see what others offer for it.  Could be anything.  Another TV, a couch, gas powered blender, heck, someone might even swap you a car for it.</p>

<p>The possibilities are unlimited.</p>

<h2>Who can become a member?</h2>

<h2>Sounds Great! How do I sign up?</h2>
<h3>Simply click on the login link at the top of the page and there will be an option to register.
<p>The only required information is a username, password, date of birth, and valid email address.  An email will be sent to the address you register with instructions and a link to confirm your account.</p></h3>

<h2>I did not receive the confirmation email.  Is there another way for me to confirm my account?</h2>
<h3>Make sure that you check your Junk mail folder as sometimes our email may be flagged as spam by your email software.  The email address that the confirmation comes from is <?= $config[site][noreply] ?>.  If needed, you may have to add this to your spam filter's whitelist in order to receive your confirmation.

<p>If you still have not received your confirmation code, go back to the login screen and enter your email address.  The confirmation code will be sent to you again.</p>

<p>If you still cannot confirm your account, send an email to <a href="mailto:admin<?= $config[site][contact] ?>?subject=Account%20Confirmation%20Request"><?= $config[site][contact] ?></a> and we will reply as soon as possible with your confirmation code.</p></h3>

<h2>What is this number next to my username?</h2>

<h3>This is your feedback score.

<p>This number helps promote honest and fair trading between members on the site.</p>

<p>Every member has a feedback score.  It works similar to the score on some largish online auction sites.  For every swap, there is a chance for both members to leave either positive, negative, or neutral feedback about the swap as well as a brief comment.  If someone's score drops below a certain threshold, then their account will be suspended and/or the member will be unable to swap items.</p>

<p>This way, we can help you avoid problem members or people who are trying to swap broken items (for example, a radio that does not work) without listing the item as being such.</p>
