<h2>About Us (The story of Okinawa Swap)</h2>

<p>Okinawa Swap was initially created with the idea of being strictly a used book and game swapping site.  You have books laying around or games you've played through, and now they are just sitting around collecting dust.</p>

<p>The plan was, let people swap games and books, and in the process, let them save a little cash by simply trading one item for another.</p>

<p>Once I started working on the initial layout, and creating the database, I approached some people I know and asked them about the usefullness of such a game swapping site.  Everyone I asked said it sounded like a good idea, however, why not just let people trade anything they want?  Why limit it to just books and games?</p>

<p>So, the site was scrapped, and arose as you see it today.  Lots of categories, uploadable pictures, RSS feeds of new items and more.<p>

<p>Once more, I showed the site to the same people and they all agreed that one thing was missing.  Why limit people to simply swapping stuff for other stuff?  "Can I swap my stuff for cash?" as one of them said.  With just a little more work, selling items on the site has become possible.</p>

<p>However, with swapping, comes problems.  We all know that some people can "bend the truth" a bit, so in order to keep people honest, we have had to implement a feedback system, similar to how some big online auction sites do.  If the item is as described, reward the person you got it from with some positive feedback.  If someone keeps trading broken junk that is not described as such, give them neutral or negative feedback.</p>

<p>Anywyas, I hope you enjoy the site and find it useful.  As always, we are open to suggestions and improvements.  Simply hit the <a href="?p=contact">Contact</a> page for the appropriate addresses.</p>

<p>Happy Swapping!</p>
